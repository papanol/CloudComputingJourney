Cloud Computing Journey Repository
This repository documents my journey in cloud computing, serving as a personal reference for learning, experimentation, and project development. Each branch represents a core area of cloud technology that I’ve focused on, including Bash scripting, Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, and Terraform. Below is a brief overview of each branch and its purpose.

Branches Overview
BashScripting
This branch contains a collection of Bash scripts developed for automating system tasks, managing configurations, and improving workflow efficiency. Each script is documented to provide context and usage details.

Ansible
Dedicated to configuration management and automation using Ansible. Here, I’ve included playbooks, roles, and modules to manage servers and deploy applications efficiently.

Docker
This branch includes Dockerfiles, container orchestration examples, and Docker Compose configurations. It showcases containerization practices and microservices deployments.

Jenkins
This branch is focused on Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins. Included here are configuration files, pipeline scripts, and plugins that automate build and deployment processes.

Terraform
A branch for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, including modular configurations, best practices, and deployment scripts for provisioning cloud resources.

Repository Goals
Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation on cloud technologies.
Reference: Act as a go-to reference for essential cloud computing practices.
Learning Resource: Track progress and facilitate continuous learning across different areas of cloud computing.
